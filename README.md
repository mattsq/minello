## Quick Start

1. **Clone and install**
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>

3. **Configure environment**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   # Edit .env.local with your Supabase credentials
   ```

4. **Run the app**
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   # Visit http://localhost:3000
   ```

5. **Run tests** (optional)
   ```bash

   pnpm test:e2e
   ```
