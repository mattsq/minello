# Gemini Agent Documentation

This file serves as a pointer to the main agent configuration documentation.

For detailed agent instructions, project structure, tickets, and guidelines, see [CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md).

The CLAUDE.md file contains comprehensive documentation for all AI coding agents, including:

- Project overview and architecture
- Ground rules and quality standards
- Repository layout and tooling
- Detailed tickets with acceptance tests
- Data model specifications
- CI/CD configuration

All agents (Claude, Gemini, and others) should follow the same guidelines specified in CLAUDE.md to ensure consistency and quality across the codebase.

## Quick Start

1. Read [CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md) for full project context
2. Review the [Ground Rules](./CLAUDE.md#ground-rules-for-agents)
3. Pick a ticket from [Tickets (Ready to Run)](./CLAUDE.md#tickets-ready-to-run)
